Ironmelt is a program designed to decode binary savegame files generated by some Clausewitz Engine games (mainly for Ironman games) to save them in human-readable text format.
Currently Ironmelt supports Europa Universalis IV, both compressed and uncompressed files. Decoded files will be written as the program without compression.

The program works in conjunction with CEIronmelt library.
